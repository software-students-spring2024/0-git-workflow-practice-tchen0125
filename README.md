## Response
This article is about China has been making significant progress in AI. Over the last six months, over 40 AI models has been approved for public use. This is because China wajnted to develop AI while striving to keep it under control. The most recent batch of approvals included 14 large language models (LLMs) and enterprise applications. These LLMs are the technology used to train services to GPT2. The approvals were given to a variety of companies, including smartphone giant Xiaomi, AI specialist and Beijing Fourth Paradigm Technology Co. I think this is interesting because this is China competing with the United States in AI development. I think it is part of a larger technology race between countries.
